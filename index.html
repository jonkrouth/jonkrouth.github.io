                        Jonathon is a software engineer at C.H. Robinson working on the Tools and Patterns team. He spends his days
                        working on making tools for the org so that they can spend more time solving business problems and less
                        time getting things setup and working. He also gets to spend time mentoring people at work with better ways to 
                        solve their problems.
                    </p>

                        In his free time, he enjoys working on coding projects, his own and open source. He likes to spend time with
                        his wife and two dogs, and enjoys going for walks with friends.
